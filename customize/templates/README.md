## FINISH CUSTOMIZATION

Follow the steps in this section to complete the customization of your new project.

### Services

Enable those services shown below that have not already been configured:

| Feature                   | Setup
| ------------------------- | ----------------
| Collaborative repository  | [Create GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
| Package manager           | [Register with Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/submit)

### Commandline Tool

To customize the name of your commandline tool:

- Rename the file `example` (the executable / front controller)
- Replace any `example` or `example.phar` in [box.json.dist](/box.json.dist) and [.gitignore](/.gitignore) with the desired name for your phar

### Release Script

To automatically attach a .phar (or some other build result) to every GitHub release:

- Run `travis setup releases` and answer the prompts. Answer "yes" to all yes/no questions.
- Edit resulting `.travis.yml` file to include the missing `skip_cleanup:` and `tags:` directives.

When you are done, the `deploy:` section should look something like this:

```
deploy:
  provider: releases
  api_key:
    secure: KmKwmt...[REDACTED]...LlE=
  file: example.phar
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
    repo: example-org/example-project
```

The `secure:` line should be filled in by `travis setup releases`.

### Documentation

Once you have finished setting up your project, delete this section and fill out the other sections of this README.

Also look over:

- [GitHub issue templates](https://github.com/{{ORG}}/{{PROJECT}}/issues/templates/edit)
- [GitHub pull request template](/.github/pull_request_template.md)
- [Contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING) (Decide about your code of conduct)

## Getting Started

Explain how to get a copy of this project up and running on a new user's local machine.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

List the things that are needed to install the software and how to install them. For most PHP projects, it should usually be sufficient to run:

```
composer install
```

If you wish to build the phar for this project, install the `box` phar builder via:

```
composer phar:install-tools
```

### Installing

Provide a step by step series of examples that show how to install this project.

Say what the step will be. If the phar for this project is the primary output, and not a mere development utility, then perhaps the first step will be to build the phar:

```
composer phar:build
```

It may then be sufficient to install via:

```
cp example.phar /usr/local/bin
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests

The test suite may be run locally by way of some simple composer scripts:

| Test             | Command
| ---------------- | ---
| Run all tests    | `composer test`
| PHPUnit tests    | `composer unit`
| PHP linter       | `composer lint`
| Code style       | `composer cs`     
| Fix style errors | `composer cbf`


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

If your project has been set up to automatically deploy its .phar with every GitHub release, then you will be able to deploy by the following procedure:

- Edit the `VERSION` file to contain the version to release, and commit the change.
- Run `composer release`
